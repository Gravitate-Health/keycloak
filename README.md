Introduction
------------
Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management application. This tool provides the security adding authentications to the applications with a easy mechanism. It is not an application for dealing with storing users or their authentications. Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.

Installation
------------
### Requirements
To deploy keycloak is necessary to have installed previously JAVA 11 JRE. 

### Deployment
First of all, we need to install our server in the [Keycloak Download](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation) to set it up locally. There are different options to do it, but in this deployment it will be choose the _.zip_ format. 

When the _.zip_ is downloaded, it is necessary to extract the content. We open the folder extracted and open a terminal with the following command:

```bash
 cd path/keycloak-17.0.1/keycloak-17.0.1/bin
```
Once this is done, we are going to start the server, to access to the keycloak interface. 

```bash
.\kc.bat start-dev
```
This command will respond with the localhost URL where is runnig our server, as follows http://127.0.0.x:8080. If we access with a browser, the keycloak interface will welcome us. In the first access is necessary to create an account by adding a username/email and a password. Once authenticated, the configuration interface of keycloak appears at the Master Realm.

A **Realm** is an object that manage a set of of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user in Keycloak belongs to only one realm and the user who logs in to Keycloak will log into that user's realm. The Master Realm contains the administrator account.

Usage
-----
Now, we need to create our own **Realm** for the project. Therefore, in the left corner where is indicated 'Master', click in _Add Realm_ an create one. As it can been seen at the top there are some tabs, to continue with the configuration. 

![Keycloak Realm Creation](./img/new_realm.png)

- The _Login_ tab. Configuration options for login as _forgot password_, _remember me_, _require SSL_, etc.
- The _Keys_ tab. Configuration the cryptographic signatures for the authentication protiocols. 
- The _Email_ tab. Keycloak sends emails to users to verify their email addresses, when they forget their passwords, or when an administrator needs to receive notifications about a server event. Therefore, this configure the SMTP server settings. 
- The _Themes_ tab. Cofiguration for change the appearance of any UI, including the language that appears.
- The _Cache_ tab. Keycloak caches everything it can in memory, through this tab you can clean it. 
- The _Localization_ tab. Localizations configured for the Realm.
- The _Tokens_ tab. Configuration to create the tokens with an specific algotithm and times. 
- The _Client Registration_ tab. Configuration of the requesites that a client must comply to be registered. 
- The _Client Policies_ tab. Policies for the validation of Client configurations Registration
- The _Securitues Defenses_ tab. As the name suggests, defenses against possible security attacks: brute force, XSS, etc.  

At the same time, in the left side exist other tabs for _Configure_: 

- Clients. Clients are applications that can request authentication of a user. 
- Clients Scope. Configuration protocol mappers and role scope mappings for multiple clients.
- Roles. Configuration to define specific applications permissions and access control.
- Identity Providers. Derivation from a specific protocol used to authenticate and send authentication and authorization information to users. 
- User Federation. Keycloak can store and manage users. It can be configured to validate credentials from LDAP or Active Directory services.
- Authetication. Configuration of a flow authentication container for the log in, registration, and other Keycloak workflows. 
  
Also in the lower left side, it is a section for _Manage_ where it can be defined Groups of users, Users, Sessions or Events. Finally, it can be Export the configuration defined in a json document and Import in other Keycloak Server.
