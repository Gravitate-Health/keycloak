Introduction
------------
Keycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management application. This tool provides the security adding authentications to the applications with a easy mechanism. It is not an application for dealing with storing users or their authentications. Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.

Installation
------------
### Requirements
To deploy keycloak is necessary to have installed previously JAVA 11 JRE. 

### Deployment
First of all, we need to install our server in the [Keycloak Download](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation) to set it up locally. There are different options to do it, but in this deployment it will be choose the _.zip_ format. 

When the _.zip_ is downloaded, it is necessary to extract the content. We open the folder extracted and open a terminal with the following command:

```bash
> cd path/keycloak-17.0.1/keycloak-17.0.1/bin
```
Once this is done, we are going to start the server, to access to the keycloak interface. 

```bash
> .\kc.bat start-dev
```
This command will respond with the localhost URL where is runnig our server, as follows http://127.0.0.x:8080. If we access with a browser, the keycloak interface will welcome us. In the first access is necessary to create an account by adding a username/email and a password. Once authenticated, the configuration interface of keycloak appears at the Master Realm.

A **Realm** is an object that manage a set of of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user in Keycloak belongs to only one realm and the user who logs in to Keycloak will log into that user's realm. The Master Realm contains the administrator account
